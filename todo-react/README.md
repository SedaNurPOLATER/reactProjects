# Todo React App

We can keep a to-do list or a to-do list in the application. When we receive the data we will receive, we can cross it    out by pressing the doneTodo button. Or we can delete it by pressing the deleteTodo button.

When we want to add new data, we can add it by clicking the Add button.

And now we can see the data we want to add in our list.



We delete the data we want to delete by pressing the delete Todo button.




If you want to run the application, it will be enough to download the codes and say npm start in the editor.
